# minesweeper problem
def initialize_counts(minefield):
    """
    Minesweeper is a popular (once-popular?) puzzle game where the player's
    goal is to find and label a set of mines in a minefield. The "minefield"
    is a rectangular grid of tiles -- each tile contains either a mine or a
    number representing the number of neighboring tiles that contain a mine.
    The tiles' contents are initially hidden from the player. The player can
    reveal a tile’s contents, but must be careful not to reveal a mine
    (revealing a mine ends the game). When the player reveals a mine-free tile,
    that tile’s mine-free neighbors are also revealed, recursively. The
    player’s task is to reveal all of the mine-free tiles without revealing a
    tile that contains a mine.

    For this problem, you are given a minefield whose mine-free tiles do not
    yet contain the count of neighboring tiles that contain mines. Your task
    is to initialize these counts.

    Specifically, you are given a 2-dimensional n * m integer array (‘minefield’)
    representing the minefield. If a tile (x,y) contains a mine, then
    minefield[x][y] contains -1. Tiles that do not contain a mine currently
    contain 0.

    For example, suppose you are given a 3 * 4 minefield with two mines, one
    at (0,2) and the other at (1, 0). minefield would look like this:

    minefield = [ [ 0, 0, -1, 0],
                  [-1, 0,  0, 0],
                  [ 0, 0,  0, 0] ]

    You can see that the counts for the mine-free tiles are not yet calculated.
    Recall that each mine-free tile should contain the number of neighboring
    tiles that contain a mine. Neighbors include diagonals; for example, the
    neighbors of tile (0, 0) are (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1).

    For the above example, here’s what minefield should look like when
    initialize_counts returns:

    [ [ 1, 2, -1, 1],
      [-1, 2,  1, 1],
      [ 1, 1,  0, 0] ]

    Notes:
        * Do not return a new array -- update the one passed in as an argument
        * Do not change the mines. In other words, if an index contains -1
          before initialize_counts runs, it should contain -1 after
          initialize_counts runs

    Args:
        (List[List[int]]) minefield: 2D array representing the minefield

    Returns:
        (None) This method doesn't return anything; it updates the argument instead
